# Business-Market-Analysis

The tasks we are doing in this session include the following:
  - Understand the relation between the items so as to make necessary recommendations, which in turn      promote the sales. 
  - Find the interesting patterns or item relationships within the transaction data set if any
  - Apply the Apriori algorithm to find association rules.
